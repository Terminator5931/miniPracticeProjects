    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix together all the ingredients for the dry batter - chilli powder, chilli paste, garlic paste, all purpose
            flour, cornflour and salt. This will become a scraggly crumb like mixture
        </li>
        <li>
            Add potatoes and coat them well in the dry batter
        </li>
        <li>
            Deep fry the potatoes in batches. Drop them one potato at a time so they don't stick together
        </li>
        <li>
            Deep fry on a medium high flame for a few minutes till the potatoes are almost cooked and golden brown.
            Remove and set aside
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a thick batter by mixing together all purpose flour, corn flour, pepper and water
        </li>
        <li>
            Dip each half fried potato stick in it
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry the batter coated potatoes on high heat. Make sure to add potatoes one at a time so they don't stick to
            each other too much. Fry the potatoes in batch so you don't overcrowd the pan
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry till they are a nice golden brown. Remove on a tissue lined plate and set aside
        </li>
        <li>
            As soon as the potatoes are fried, heat oil in a large wok and add garlic. Saute the garlic for 30 seconds.
            Don't let it brown
        </li>
        <li>
            Add sesame seeds and saute for another 30 seconds or so, being careful not to brown them or they can taste
            burnt
        </li>
        <li>
            Add soy sauce, honey, ketchup, chilli paste, chilli flakes, vinegar and water and mix well
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the potatoes and toss them well so that the sauce covers the potatoes
        </li>
        <li>
            Add cornflour slurry and toss again for a minute or two till the cornflour cooks through
        </li>
        <li>
            The Honey Chilli Potatoes are ready to go!
