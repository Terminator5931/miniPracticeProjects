    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Nobody can resist these perfect pyramids of flaky pastry, stuffed with a delicious spiced potato filling! But not all samosas are created equal. Too dry, not enough filling, bad pastry, weak spicing….. So I set out to make my own, and am proud to now share with you my very own Samosa recipe – my idea of the perfect Samosa!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Ghee or Oil</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Peas</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix dry ingredients, add ghee – Mix the flour, Ajwain seeds and salt, then pour the ghee or oil in</li>
        <li>Rub fat in – Use your fingers to rub the ghee in until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs. This is the step that gives the Samosa pastry the signature flakiness we know and love so much!</li>
        <li>Form dough, rest 30 minutes – We then add water until it is wet enough to form a dough. The dough should be soft and pliable, but not so sticky that it sticks to your hands. Form a ball and let it rest for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Divide – Form a log, then cut into 6 equal pieces</li>
        <li>Shape dough into balls</li>
        <li>Roll out balls to 2mm thick – Roll the dough balls into discs 2mm thick. They should be about 16cm /6.5” in diameter.</li>
        <li>Voila! You’re done!</li>
    </ol>
